So, first what you need to do is head over to discordapp.com/developers and create a bot account for your bot. You can
customize it how you want here, like avatar and name.

Then, go to the bot tab, hit add bot to create a bot user, and copy the token and paste that inside the ./data/settings.json file,
where it indicates where the token should be.

Cool, you have the user set up. Now, to invite it, click the OAuth tab on the bots page, and click the checkbox that says "bot".
Copy-paste that link into a browser, and add it to your server.

Hooray! You're not useless and managed to invite it! Now, go into ./data/words.json. There, you will find two fields.
The first field is called an "array". It is basically a list of words that will be watched for by the bot. The formatting goes
like this:

["word", "word2", "word3"]

etc. The other is the response message. That is sent once it finds a message with a word inside of it.

Now you need node.js. Super easy install, just head over to nodejs.org and download and install. EZ stuff.

Now, to make the bot go online, because that seems pretty important, simply open a CMD window, type "cd " and then the path
to the bot directory. Should looks something like this:

"cd C:\The\Path\To\The\Bot"

then, type "node index". It should then be online.

KEEP IN MIND: You either need to keep your PC on 24/7 or have some other way of hosting for it to stay online all the time.
There are websites and such that can allow you to do that, but I don't use them so don't ask me :P
